# Configure Fork

If you don't have Fork yet, give it a try ðŸ‘€

[Fork official site](https://git-fork.com)

## Configure the workspace

In order to work with organization, start by creating a new Directory in your workspace root folder:

#### Windows

`C:/Repositories`

#### MacOS / Linux

`~/Repositories`

> You can rename the directory whatever you want, the goal here is to create a directory **only** to store the repositories that you'll work with

## Configure Fork

### Accounts

1. Go to Forks top menu and search for the **Accounts** option
1. Go ahead and click in the **+** button
1. Choose the account that you want. For this project, choose the **GitHub** option
1. Login and follow the steps

### Preferences

1. Go to Forks top menu and search for the **Preferences** option
1. In the **Default Source Folder** choose the directory that you've created in the `Configure the workspace` step
1. Continue to configure Fork as you like

Now, you are all good to start "Gitting" ðŸ¤©
